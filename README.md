# Process-Monitor
Developed a process monitor similar to the task manager in windows.

Once the python script is run, the tkinter gui opens up showing all the processes, their states, memory usage, CPU usage, owner of the processes and many other important details. 
Also, the user is given a chance to resume, suspend or search for a process. Even though, the page is refreshed every 5 secs, the user can manually refresh the page to see the updated list.
